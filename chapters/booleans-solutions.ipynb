    "    1. Write an `if`-`else` code block that checks to see if a guessed `x` value is a solution to this equation.  Do not use the `==` operator but rather check to see if the absolute value of the difference is less than $1 \\times 10^-4$.  Each block of the `if`-`else` should print an appropriate sentence indicating whether the guessed value is a solution or not. The `else` block should also print off the absolute value of the difference so you know how far off your guess was.\n",

    "2. (Thermoelectrics)  A thermoelectric is a material that converts thermal energy into electrical energy.   and much research is devoted to finding new materials that exhibit this behavior.  Good thermoelectrics tend to be materials with high electrical conducitivity ($\\sigma > 7 \\times 10^5~\\Omega^{-1} \\text{m}^{-1}$ ) **and** low thermal conductivity ($\\kappa< 2.0$ W/ m K ).  Write an `if`-`else` code block that checks to see if a material's electrical conductivity is above the threshold **and** its thermal conductivity is below the threshold.  Then choose some values for the conductivities and test your `if`-`else` block.\n"

    "3. Alloys are often represented by a string containing the elements in the alloy and the relative number of atoms for each element. For example, \"Cu2Au\" (Copper-2-Gold) means that the alloy is made of copper and gold and there are two copper atoms for every gold atom.  Write some python code that calculates the total number of atoms in an alloy.  The code should include a print statement to display the result.  Then check your code on the alloys in the table below. You can assume that all elements have two-character symbols even though that isn't true; we won't consider any one-character symbols in this problem.\n",

    "5. (Triangle Classification)  There is a simple criteria to determine whether a triangle can be formed from a set of specified side lengths.  The criteria states that the sum of any two sides must be larger than the third side.  This criteria must be satisified for all possible combinations of two sides if the triangle is to be valid.  If the triangle is valid, the angles can be found by first using the law of cosines to find the first two angles $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \\cos(C)$$  and then choosing the third angle so that the sum of the three angles add up to $180^\\circ$.\n",

All valid triangles are classified according to the largest angle present (acute, obtuse, and right) and also according to their side lengths (scalene - no sides equal, isoscelese - two sides equal and equilateral - all sides equal). Modify your code to determine the classification of a triangle (i.e. obtuse scalene) and print that classification to screen.\n"
