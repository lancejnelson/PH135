# Pandas

Pandas is a Python package built to work with spreadsheet-like data, and it is very good at its job.  Pandas stores data in something called a "dataframe". A dataframe is simply data stored in rows and columns. As an example, here is some sample data taken by an accelerometer sitting on an elevator floor:

time,gFx,gFy,gFz  
0.007,-0.0056,-0.0046,1.012  
0.008,0.0007,0.0024,1.0022  
0.008,0,0.0059,1.0039  
0.009,0.0054,-0.0022,1.0032  
0.009,-0.0015,-0.0056,1.0042  
0.009,0.0037,-0.002,0.9951  
0.01,-0.002,-0.002,1.002  
0.014,0.009,-0.0024,1.0159  
0.015,0.0012,-0.0037,1.01  
0.017,-0.0115,-0.002,1.0012  
0.019,-0.0022,-0.0015,1.001  
0.021,0.0024,-0.0022,1.0166  

and here is the same data loaded into a dataframe.

```
   time     gFx     gFy     gFz  
0  0.007 -0.0056 -0.0046  1.0120  
1  0.008  0.0007  0.0024  1.0022  
2  0.008  0.0000  0.0059  1.0039  
3  0.009  0.0054 -0.0022  1.0032  
4  0.009 -0.0015 -0.0056  1.0042  
5  0.009  0.0037 -0.0020  0.9951  
6  0.010 -0.0020 -0.0020  1.0020  
7  0.014  0.0090 -0.0024  1.0159  
8  0.015  0.0012 -0.0037  1.0100  
9  0.017 -0.0115 -0.0020  1.0012 
``` 

The most-used function from the pandas module is `read_csv` which is used to read a csv-formatted file into a dataframe:

```{python}
from pandas import read_csv

elevator_data = read_csv("elevator.csv")
print(elevator_data)
```
