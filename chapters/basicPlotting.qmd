# Basis Plotting
Creating plots is an important task in science and engineering. The old addage “A picture is worth a thousand words!” is wrong.... it’s worth way more than that if
you do it right.  When making plots on a computer it is important to remember that computers don't plot functions, rather they plot individual points


## Plotting Functions of a Single Variable


Simple plots of x vs. y are done using a library called `matplotlib`. In order to make a plot, matplotlib needs lists of x and y points that are going to be plotted. It cannot generate these points on its own. To build an array x of x-values starting at x = 0, ending at x = 10, and having a step size of .01, you’ll need numpy’s arange function:

```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot
from numpy import arange,sin,pi,cos

x = arange(0,2 * pi/5,.01)
y = sin(5 * x)
y2 = cos(5 * x)

pyplot.figure()
pyplot.plot(x,y)
pyplot.plot(x,y2)
pyplot.show()

```
