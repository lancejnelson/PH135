Strings can contain a variety of characters including letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n\n### Creating Strings\n\nStrings are created by placing the sequence of characters in single (or double) quotes.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntext = \"some text\"\n```\n\n\nStrings can also be created by converting a float or an integer into a string using the `str()` function.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntext = str(4.5)\n```\n\n\nOne common error made when working with strings is to attempt to perform math with them. Python will not perform math with strings because it sees them as a series of characters and nothing more. In the cell below, we attempt to perform math with some strings.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = \"4\"\nb = \"2\"\nc = 2\n\nd = a + b\ne = a * b\nf = b * c\n```\n\n\n>**_To Do:_**\n>\n>1. Use print statements in the cell above to determine what happens when you add two strings together.\n>2. Use print statements in the cell above to determine what happens when you multiply two strings.\n>3. Use print statements in the cell above to determine what happens when you multiply a string and an integer.\n\nIf you want to know the length of a string, you can use the `len()` function\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntext = \"some text\"\nlen(text)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe length of the string above is 9 because a space is a valid character.\n\n### Displaying text and numbers together\n\nYou have been using `print()` statements quite a lot lately (hopefully) but you probably haven't printed text and numbers together.  To display both text and numbers in the same message, there are several options.  The first is to just put multiple variables into the `print()` function, separating them with commas.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ng = 9.8\nunit = \"m/s^2\"\nprint(g,unit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n9.8 m/s^2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother option is to convert the number to a string and then \"add\" it to the other string. This creates a single string as an argument to the `print()` function.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ng = 9.8\nunit = \"m/s^2\"\nprint(str(g) + unit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n9.8m/s^2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice the lack of space between the number and the unit.  \"Adding\" the two strings smashed them together exactly as they were, no spaces added. You can insert multiple numbers into a string using something called \"f\"-strings. (short for formatted strings). To construct an f-string, simply place an \"f\" in front of the string.  Anytime you want to insert a number in your string, enclose it in curly braces.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nv = 5.0\nc = 3e8\nprint(f\"The speed of light is {c} and the speed of my car is {v}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe speed of light is 300000000.0 and the speed of my car is 5.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can specify how the number should be formatted by placing a `:` after the variable name followed by a formatting tag.  Here are a few examples to explore:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nv1 = 5.0\nv2 = 8.3\nc = 2.998e8\nn = 2\n\nprint(f\"There are {n:d} cars traveling side by side.  One car is traveling at {v1:4.2f} m/s and the other is traveling at {v2:4.2f} m/s.  Those speeds are much smaller than the speed of light, which is {c:.2e} m/s\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThere are 2 cars traveling side by side.  One car is traveling at 5.00 m/s and the other is traveling at 8.30 m/s.  Those speeds are much smaller than the speed of light, which is 3.00e+08 m/s\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the formatting tag tells the print statement how the number should be printed.  For float variables, the formatting tag will have two numbers followed by an \"f\" (for float).  The first number indicates how many total spaces should be allocated to print the number and the second number specifies the number of decimal places that should be displayed.  For integer variables, use the formatting tag \"g\".  For bigger numbers, it is often useful to print the number in scientific notation.  To do this, use the \".2e\" formatting tag.  The number after the decimal indicates how many numbers after the decimal should be displayed.\n\n\n>**_To Do:_**\n>\n>1. Modify the print statement above so that the float variables are given 8 total spaces with only 1 number after the decimal being displayed.\n>2. Modify the print statement above so that the speed of light is displayed with 3 numbers after the decimal place.\n\n\n### Indexing and Slicing\n\n  Accessing a piece (or slice) of a string is a common task in scientific computing. Often you will import data into Python from a text file and need to extract a portion of the file for later use in calculations.  Indexing allows the user to extract a single element, or character, from a string. The key detail about indexing in Python is that *indices start from zero*.  That means that the first character is index zero, the second character is index 1, and so on.  For example, maybe a string contains the following amino acid sequence 'MSLFKIRMPE'.  For this example, the indices are as follows:\n  \n| **Characters**|M|S|L|F|K|I|R|M|P|E|\n| --------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| **Index** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n  \n  \n  \n\nTo access a single character from a string, place the desired index in square brackets after the name of the string.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPI\"\nseq[0]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```\n'M'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo access the last character in a string you could do\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPI\"\nseq[len(seq) - 1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```\n'I'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut this seems overly cumbersome. An easier approach is to index backwards.  The string can be reverse indexed from the last character to the first using negative indices, starting with -1 as the last charcter.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPE\"\nseq[-1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n'E'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n>**_To Do:_**\n>\n>1. Access the 5th character in the peptide sequence above.\n>2. Access the character that is 3rd from the end in the peptide sequence above.\n\nIndexing only provides a single character, but it is common to want a series of characters from a string.  *Slicing* allows us to grab a section of a string. Slicing is performed by specifying start and stop indices separated by a colon in the square brackets.  One important detail worth mentioning: the character at the starting index is included in the slice while the character located at the final index *is not* included in the slice.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPE\"\nseq[0:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n```\n'MSLFK'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the string, you notice that the character at location 5 (I) has been excluded from the slice.  You can leave off the first number when slicing and the slice will  start at the beginning of the string.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPE\"\nseq[:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n```\n'MSLFK'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also use negative indices when slicing.  This is especially helpful when you want to grab the last few characters in a string.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfile = \"data.txt\"\next = file[-3:]\n```\n\n\nFinally, we can adjust the step size in the slice.  That is, we can ask for every other character in the string by setting a step size of 2.  The structure of the slice is [start,stop,step].\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPE\"\nseq[0:8:2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```\n'MLKR'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can omit the start and stop indices and Python will assume that you are slicing the entire string.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nseq = \"MSLFKIRMPE\"\nseq[::2]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n```\n'MLKRP'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### String Methods\n\nA *method* is a function that works only with a specif type of object. String methods only work on strings, and they don't work on other types of objects, like floats or ints. If it helps you, you can just think of a method as a function.  \n\nOne example of a string method is the `capitalize()` function which returns a string with the first letter capitalized.  To use a method (referred to as *calling* the method), the method name is appended to the variable you want it to operate on.  For example, below is an Albert Einstein quote that needs capitalized.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nquote = \"i want to know God's thoughts. The rest are details.\"\nquote.capitalize()\nprint(quote)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ni want to know God's thoughts. The rest are details.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the original variable (quote) remains unchanged.  This particular method does not change the value of the original string but rather returns a capitalized version of it.  If we want to save the capitalized version, we can assign it to a new variable, or overwrite the original.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nquote = \"i want to know God's thoughts. The rest are details\"\nquote = quote.capitalize()\nprint(quote)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nI want to know god's thoughts. the rest are details\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the cell below you will find a list of commonly-used string methods.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = \"spdfgssfpggg\"\na.capitalize()\na.center(10)\na.count(\"s\")\na.find(\"d\")\na.isalnum()\na.isalpha()\na.isdigit()\na.lstrip(\"s\")\na.rstrip(\"g\")\na.split(\"s\")\na.startswith(\"s\")\na.endswith(\"p\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=18}\n```\nFalse\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n>**_To Do:_**\n>\n>1. Use well-placed print statements to determine what each string method does.\n>2. Add comments next to each method for future reference.\n>\n\n## Exercises\n\n\n1.
