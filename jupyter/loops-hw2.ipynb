    "1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the greatest positive integer that divides each of the numbers. For example, the GCD of $30$ and $20$ is $10$ (i.e. There is no number greater than $10$ that divides both $30$ and $20$).  One algorithm for finding this number is called Euclid's algorithm.  The process for Euclid's algorithm is as follows: (as long as both numbers are not negative.)\n",

    "    - Find the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number.\n",
    "    - Replace the larger number with the number found in step 1.\n",
    "    - Repeat this process until one of the numbers is zero.  At this point, the other number is the GCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Use a `while` loop to find the GCD of $105$ and $252$.  You may want to find the GCD of smaller numbers first to verify that your code is working.\n",
    "    2. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that two or more numbers can divide evenly. For example, the LCM of $6$ and $4$ is $12$ (i.e. There is no number smaller than $12$ that is also a multiple of both $6$ and $4$). The LCM can be found from the GCD using the following expression: $LCM(a,b) = {a \\times b\\over GCD(a,b)}$. Calculate the LCM of $105$ and $252$.\n",
    "    3. If $GCD(a,b) = 1$ then the numbers are considered co-prime. Can you find a co-prime pair?"

    "2. Another interesting summation is given by: $$ f(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k {1\\over n^k} = {1\\over n^0} - {1\\over n^1} + {1\\over n^2} - {1\\over n^3} + {1\\over n^4} - \\dots$$  This sum converges (approaches) the value ${n \\over n + 1}$ only if $n > 1$.\n",

    "    1. Use a `for` loop to evaluate $f(2)$ and $f(4)$ and verify that $f(2) = {2 \\over 2 + 1} = {2\\over 3}$ and $f(4) = {4 \\over 4 + 1} = {4\\over 5}$.  This summation is called an infinite sum and we surely don't want our loop to continue forever!! Instead, an infinite sum like this one can be approximated with a `for` loop with a large number of iterations.  To determine if you have included enough terms, increase the number of terms steadily and watch for the final result to stop changing appreciably.\n",
    "    2. Now repeat part 1 using list comprehension and the `sum` function?\n",
    "    3. Repeat the exercise one final time using a `while` loop.  Write the `while` loop so that it stops iterating when the value of ${1\\over n^k}$ gets smaller than $1 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n",
    "    4. Now investigate what happens when $n = 0.5$.  Do this by running your `for` loop from part 1 for more and more iterations and observing whether the sum approach one value (converges) or increases without bound (diverges). "

    "(Extra Credit) A transcendental equation is one that cannot be solved analytically (with pencil and paper). Try solving the following equation for x to see what I mean: $$ {\\cos x \\over x} = 1$$  One numerical method for solving an equation like this involves first rearranging it to look like this: $$ x = \\cos x$$ and then using a loop to repeatedly evaluating the right hand side, using the result of the previous evaluation as the input, until $x$ and $\\cos(x)$ are essentially equal (to within $1 \\times 10^{-3}$ is sufficient). [^relax] The first few iterations of this process might look something like this: $$(x_\\text{old})_1 = 2 \\text{ (starting guess)}$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_1 = \\cos((x_\\text{old})_1)$$ $$(x_\\text{old})_2 = (x_\\text{new})_1$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_2 = \\cos((x_\\text{old})_2)$$ $$(x_\\text{old})_3 = (x_\\text{new})_2$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_3 = \\cos((x_\\text{old})_3)$$\n",
