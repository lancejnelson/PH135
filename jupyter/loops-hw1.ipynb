    "2. Summations appear often in science and mathematics.  One such summation is called the Riemann Zeta function and is given by $$ \\zeta(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {1\\over k^n} = {1\\over 1^n} + {1\\over 2^n} + {1\\over 3^n} + \\dots$$\n",

This summation is called an infinite sum and we surely don't want our loop to continue forever!! Instead, an infinite sum like this one can be approximated with a `for` loop with a large number of iterations.  To determine if you have included enough terms, increase the number of terms steadily and watch for the final result to stop changing appreciably.\n",

    "3. (Prime numbers) A prime number is a number that is not the product of two smaller numbers except $1$. (i.e it is only evenly divisible by itself and $1$) To determine whether a number ($n$) is prime, check to see if the number is divisible by **any integer** starting at $2$ and ending at $\\sqrt{n}$ (rounded up). If the number is divisible by even one of these integers, you know the number isn't prime.\n",
