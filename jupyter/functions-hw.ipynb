The expression for the position of the block after $t$ seconds have elapsed is $$x(t) = v_0 t - {1\\over 2} \\mu g t^2$$ where $\\mu$ is the coefficient of friction and $g = 9.8$ m/s$^2$.  You can easily calculate the time it takes for the block to come to rest to be $$ T = {v_0 \\over \\mu g}$$.  \n",

When an electron transitions from a high energy state to a low energy state, it releases a bundle of light (called a \"photon\") with an energy that is exactly equal to the energy difference.
