        "1. (Physical Constants)  The field of physics is filled with experimental constants.  In fact, you'll use some of them so frequently throughout your undergraduate experience that you'll end up memorizing them. Until then it could be useful to store some of these constants in a dictionary for easy reference.  Choose at least 15 constants from the following [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants) and build a dictionary of them.  Make sure that the following constants are in your list: $k_B$, $\\hbar$, $c$, $e$, and $\\epsilon_0$. You are free to choose the names of the keys to be anything that makes good sense to you.\n",

Construct a dictionary that contains many of the most useful unit conversions, including those shown below.  You are free to choose the key names to be whatever makes most sense to you.
