        "In this chapter you will learn how to plot functions of more than one variable $F(x,y)$. Functions like this can be visualized by making a contour plots (like a topographic map) or by displaying the function value as height above the $x-y$ plane like a perspective drawing. You can also display vector-valued function $\\mathbf{F}(x,y)$ using vector field plots.\n",

        "When plotting a function of one variable, recall that the first step was to use `linspace` or `arange` to construct a grid of points spanning the domain of the function.  For a function of two variables the domain is two-dimensional and hence the grid will also need to be two-dimensional.  In other words, we need to construct a set of x-y pairs that spans the two-dimensional domain. We can do this using  `numpy.meshgrid` and `numpy.mgrid`. Let's see an example and then explain the pieces.  Below you will find some code to plot the function: $$f(x,y) = \\cos({\\pi \\over 2} x) \\exp(-y^2)$$ (see the code comments)\n"

You can plot a vector field using the `quiver` function, which takes four required arguments. The first two are the output from `meshgrid` just as with the other plots we have done.  The third and fourth arguments are the components of the vectors at each (x,y) pair.

(Extra Credit) The angle of impact for a projectile launched with initial speed $v$, launch angle $\\theta$, and initial height $y_0$ is given by: $$ \\phi = \\tan^{-1} \\left( {\\sqrt{v^2 \\sin^2\\theta + 2 g y_0} \\over v \\cos \\theta} \\right) $$  Plot the impact angle as a function of $v$ and $\\theta$ ($\\phi(v,\\theta)$) for $0 < v_i < 50$ m/s and $0 < \\theta < 90^\\circ$ and $y_i = 10$ m.   Then write a single sentence summarizing the results of the plot."
