Instead we have to resort to a class of numerical algorithms generally referred to as root finding or optimization algorithms.

In the remainder of this chapter we will discuss various numerical methods for finding the roots of an equation.\n",

If you want to find the location where the function equals something other than zero, you can simply rearrange the function until a zero appears on the right hand side of the equation and proceed with bisection on the new function.  To begin the bisection method, the user must choose an interval wherein the function zero is guaranteed to be found.  The midpoint of the interval is then found and a new, narrower interval is chosen.  By repeating this process until the interval becomes sufficiently small, the algorithm eventually finds the location where the function is equal to zero.  The steps to the algorithm are as follows:  \n",
