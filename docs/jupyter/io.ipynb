        "Up to now, we have been working with computer-generated or manually typed data sets.  Often in a scientific setting your data will be stored in a file and you will need to read the contents of the file into Python so you can perform an analysis.  Most data files are *text* files, but there is a large variety of these that differ mostly in the way the information is formatted.   The file extension (i.e., the 3 or 4 letters after the period at the end of a file name) specifies the formatting of the file.  For example, a *.csv* file (short for comma-separated values) has commas to separate the information.\n",

The file is pretty large and the data is not well-structured at all even though there is valuable information inside.  Reading this file is definitely a job for `open` and `readlines` rather than `numpy.genfromtxt()`.  Periodically in this file there are lines that look like this:  \n",
        "`  free energy     TOTEN =             -72.3092`  \n",
        "and you need to extract the numbers from all of these lines.  Use the following steps to build a list containing these numbers:  \n",
        "    1. Use the `open` and `readlines` functions to read this file into a list of strings.\n",
        "    2. Iterate over this list and look for lines that contain the string \"TOTEN\".\n",
        "    3. When you find a line that has this string in it, `split` the string and extract the number. Make sure you convert the number into a float.\n",
        "    4. Append this number to a list that you defined initially to be empty.  \n",
        "    \n",
        "   When you have built the list of energies, determine:     \n",
        "    1. The number of energies in your list.\n",
        "    2. The average of the last 5 entries.\n",
        "    3. The minimum and maximum energies in your list. \n"
